  + You are expected to submit your project before 7pm on Sunday, Dec 2nd 2018.

  + Plan your time well!
  + Divide your work between the members so that you make the most of your available time.

  + Ensure that binary files, temporary files, auto-generated files are not checked into Git.
  + Additional points for a neatly organized directory structure, code quality, well documented code, well defined Git commit messages.
  + The process to submit your code will be informed separately.
